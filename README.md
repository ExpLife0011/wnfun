# WNFUN
WNF Utilities 4 Newbies (WNFUN) is the repository for the Python scripts and C tools that Gabrielle Viala (@pwissenlit) and Alex Ionescu (@aionescu) wrote for their BlackHat 2018 presentation on the Windows Notification Facility.

## Caveat

These tools are still in PoC stage which we hope the community can use to build more mature and better tools. We will probably be making small improvements to them from time to time, especially error handling and better help, but we wanted to be able to share them with the public ahead of time.
